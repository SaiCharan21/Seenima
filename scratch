<h1 align="center"> About Us </h1>
    <p> Seenima is a movie rental experience for the new generation. New users of our website have a free 7-day trial
        with a wide selection of movies from all genres. Once the free trial concludes, movie rental prices depend on
        the amount of time a movie is rented, and whether a user decides to become a member or not. Non-membership
        prices per film are $1.99 for one day and $3.49 for two days. If you are a member, your monthly subscription fee
        is $7.99, and that allows for unlimited rentals until your membership concludes. Customers can rent movies or
        purchase a membership via credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or alternatively, Bitcoin.</p>

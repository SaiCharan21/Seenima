<h1 align = "center"> About Us </h1>
<p> Seenima is a movie rental experience for the new generation. New users of our website have a free 7-day trial with a wide selection of movies from all genres. Once the free trial concludes, movie rental prices depend on the amount of time a movie is rented, and whether a user decides to become a member or not. Non-membership prices per film are $1.99 for one day and $3.49 for two days. If you are a member, your monthly subscription fee is $7.99, and that allows for unlimited rentals until your membership concludes. Customers can rent movies or purchase a membership via credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or alternatively, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>When a non-member rents a movie for a certain period, it will automatically be removed from your watchlist at that time with no additional charges. Customers can become members by signing in with their email and a secure password. When signing in they can manage their account, billing, favorite movies, and much more. On our home page, there is a customer survey for members and non-members to fill out if they wish with different preference questions, including new rental material they may want to see.</p>
<p>Don’t know what to watch? We have a recommended movie list for you that shows the latest releases as well as a trending movie list to see the most watched movies by other Seenima viewers! As a Seenima member, you can connect with friends to see their reviews for different movies they have watched. You can also opt-in to Sharewatch, our friendly movie-sharing feature so your connections on Seenima can see what you are enjoying watching and you can see theirs! This is an opt-in feature that is not automatically on, you can also create a Close Friends list to share different genres or ratings with your close friends!</p>
